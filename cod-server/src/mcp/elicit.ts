/**
 * Human-in-the-loop (HITL) tool classification.
 *
 * DANGEROUS_TOOLS is the hard-coded allowlist of tools that ALWAYS require
 * user confirmation before executing — deletes across domains, driver
 * settlements, stock adjustments, order status changes. Risk classification
 * lives in ONE file reviewers can audit at a glance; adding a destructive
 * tool means editing this file in the same change.
 *
 * Confirmation policy (Slice 2):
 * The MCP wrapper fails CLOSED for dangerous tools — they refuse to run —
 * until Slice 3 wires SDK v2 `inputRequired` confirmation. Failing closed is
 * strictly safer than the previous SDK v1 `elicitInput` path, which was broken
 * for Streamable HTTP (an empty relatedRequestId never reached a live stream).
